WHAT YOU HAVE NOW:
==================

1. pe_extractor.py       - Automated PE section extraction script
2. README.md             - Complete overview and checklist
3. QUICKSTART.md         - 5-minute quick start guide  
4. ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md     - Complete step-by-step methodology
5. BGSTART_ANALYSIS.md   - Detailed BGStart.exe analysis


YOUR 3-STEP QUICK START:
========================

STEP 1: Extract All PE Sections (2 minutes)
--------------------------------------------
Open terminal and run:

    cd "E:\MMORPG\Decompile"
    python pe_extractor.py "ACTIVTRAK Agent\SourceDir\SystemFolder"

This creates folders for each .exe with extracted data.


STEP 2: Review Extracted Data (5 minutes)
------------------------------------------
Check what BGStart does:

    type "BGStart\imports.txt"
    type "BGStart\strings.txt" | findstr /i "config http file registry"
    type "BGStart\metadata.txt"


STEP 3: Continue Ghidra Analysis (30+ minutes)
-----------------------------------------------
In Ghidra CodeBrowser:

    1. You're currently at the entry() function
    2. Double-click on "FUN_00644de" in the decompiler window
    3. This takes you to the MAIN program logic
    4. Right-click on "FUN_00644de" → Edit Function Signature
    5. Rename it to "main" or "WinMain"
    6. Start analyzing what the function does


UNDERSTANDING YOUR DECOMPILED CODE:
===================================

What you saw in Ghidra:
-----------------------
    void entry(void)
    {
        __security_init_cookie();  ← Security feature (buffer protection)
        FUN_00644de();             ← THE REAL PROGRAM STARTS HERE!
        return;
    }

What each part means:
---------------------
    __security_init_cookie() = Stack protection initialization
    FUN_00644de()            = Main program logic (analyze this next!)


GHIDRA KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
==========================
    G              = Go to address
    L              = Rename function/variable
    ;              = Add comment
    Ctrl+E         = Edit function signature
    Ctrl+Shift+F   = Search text
    Ctrl+D         = Bookmark


WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN FUN_00644de:
=================================

GUI Application:
    - RegisterClassEx, CreateWindowEx
    - Message loop (GetMessage, DispatchMessage)

Background Service:
    - StartServiceCtrlDispatcher
    - Service control handlers

Process Launcher:
    - CreateProcess, ShellExecute
    - Paths to other .exe files

Network Activity:
    - WSAStartup, socket, connect
    - IP addresses in strings


QUICK SEARCH COMMANDS:
======================

Find network strings:
    findstr /i "http https socket connect server ip" BGStart\strings.txt

Find file paths:
    findstr /i "C:\ appdata program" BGStart\strings.txt

Find registry keys:
    findstr /i "HKEY registry software" BGStart\strings.txt


COMPARING EXECUTABLES:
======================

Compare imports between two files:
    fc BGStart\imports.txt scthost\imports.txt

Compare strings:
    fc BGStart\strings.txt scthost\strings.txt


DOCUMENTATION GUIDE:
====================

For beginners       → Read QUICKSTART.md first
For complete guide  → Read ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md  
For BGStart details → Read BGSTART_ANALYSIS.md
For overview        → Read README.md


NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
=======================

1. Run extraction script:
   python pe_extractor.py "ACTIVTRAK Agent\SourceDir\SystemFolder"

2. Review imports.txt and strings.txt

3. In Ghidra: Double-click FUN_00644de to analyze main function

4. Rename functions as you understand them

5. Add comments to document your findings


GETTING HELP:
=============

All questions answered in the .md files!

    - How do I...?          → QUICKSTART.md
    - What does this mean?  → ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md

SAFETY REMINDER:
================

✓ Always analyze in a VM
✓ Take snapshots before running anything
✓ Disable network if analyzing malware
✓ Never run on production systems

LEGAL REMINDER:
===============

⚠️  EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY - NOT FOR EXPLOITATION  ⚠️

✓ Only analyze software you have permission to analyze
✓ Respect software licenses and terms of service
✓ Do not use knowledge to bypass security or create exploits
✓ Comply with all applicable laws (DMCA, CFAA, etc.)
✓ Use knowledge responsibly and ethically
